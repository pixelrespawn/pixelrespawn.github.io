# Introduction

## What is Linking Boy?

Linking Boy is a [GBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) emulator that makes it possible to run old GBA games on modern devices. As its name indicates, it emulates [Game Link Cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Link_Cable), allowing to play multi-player games with up to three nearby players.

It currently runs on iPhone/iPad, but support for Android is on the plan.
